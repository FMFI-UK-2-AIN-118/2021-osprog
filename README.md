TBA

Grades
-------

You can check your grades/points in the file `report.md` in branch
`report` in your repositories. A direct URL would be (don't forget
to change ‹LOGIN› for your login):

    https://github.com/FMFI-UK-2-AIN-118/osprog18-‹LOGIN›/blob/report/report.md

If you are reading this from your repository, this
[direct link](../../blob/report/report.md) should work.

Submitting
----------

To submit assigments you need to commit and push them to a branch in your fork
(of your private repository) and create a pull request against the private
repository and correct branch. **Note that the branch in the private repo against
which you create the PR determines the assigment, so be careful.**

Some documentation / tutorial on how to submit assigments can be found in the
repo for
[Mathematics 4](https://github.com/FMFI-UK-1-AIN-412/lpi/blob/master/docs/odovzdavanie.md)
(slovak only, note that there's also an option to upload files directly to
github without copy-pasting that isn't covered there).
