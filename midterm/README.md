Midterm
=======

You can get your midterm assignment at https://dai.fmph.uniba.sk/courses/osprog/midterm/.
You will have one hour to submit your solution once you click `Start` there.

The webpage uses GitHub for login management, so you will need to sign in
through GitHub and allow an app named "Osprog" by yoyko ;-) to access your
id...

Submit your solution of midterm here and make a pull request against the
"midterm" branch before your deadline.

You must take your exam before Wednesday Nov 24 23:59:59.

You can upload a document (simple text / markdown files are preferred) with
your solutions, the original pdf with comments in it, a scanned/photographed
copy of a printed and filled out midterm, or anything similar where it is clear
what the answers (and to which questions) are.

A correctly created pull request should appear in the
[list of PRs for `midterm`](https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+user%3AFMFI-UK-2-AIN-118+base%3Amidterm).
